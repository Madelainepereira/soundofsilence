# *Introduction* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/f963cbe0-2639-4950-81d2-6f41e4f9a7f5">
In a world where technology advances by leaps and bounds, it is essential that all aspects of daily life are within reach of those who face particular challenges. "Sound of Silence" is an ambitious project born from the understanding that people with hearing impairments often face a silent and disconnected environment. Detecting and understanding the sounds around us are essential elements for the safety, well-being and inclusion of these people in society.

The main objective of this project is the development of a revolutionary mobile application that will allow people with hearing impairment to experience the sound world around them. Through an intuitive interface and a focus on sound detection and categorization, "Sound of Silence" will provide a keyword.

This project focuses on utilizing cutting-edge technologies, including pre-trained AI models, frontend development with React, and robust backend logic implemented in Python. In addition, the importance of maintaining a history of the detected sounds for future service improvement is considered.

"Sound of Silence" is a step towards the inclusion and empowerment of people with hearing impairments, giving them the ability to experience the world through sound in a new and exciting way.

- **System Activation:** Users can activate the app using an activation button, allowing them to begin detecting sounds in their environment.

- **Sound Detection and Categorization:** The application is designed to detect and categorize sounds in the user's environment.

- **Show Keyword:** Along with the detected sound, the application shows four predictions along with their score for the detected sound.

- **Sign up:** People can sign up as users in the application.

- **Sound History Screen:** Users have access to a history screen that displays the most recently detected sounds along with their corresponding keywords.

In order to visualize the frontend part of this project properly you need react installed.<br>
First of all please clone the repository:<br>

        git clone https://github.com/Madelainepereira/soundofsilence.git 
Also is needed to install vite:

        npm create vite@latest .

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies for the project:

        npm install
To start the development server, use the following command:
        
        npm run dev
To display it in the browser, open your local host:
  
        http://localhost:5173

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------
In order to visualize the backend part of this project properly you need Python and FastAPI installed.<br>
First of all please clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/Anais-RV/SoundofSilence_Back.git

Run the following command to create the virtual enviroment:

        python -m venv myenv
To activate the virtual enviroment: 

        source myenv/Scrips/activate
After that we need some installations:

        pip install tensorflow

        pip install tensorflow-hub

        pip install uvicorn

        pip install pandas

        pip install sqlalchemy database[all]

        pip install pydantic

        pip install psycopg2

        pip install bcrypt
        
        chocolatey_FFnipeg

        pip install PyJWT

        pip install aiofiles

        python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

Finally in order to run the project:

        uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
