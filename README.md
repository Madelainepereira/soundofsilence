# *Introduction* <img width = 50px, height = 50px src="https://github.com/nati-Bel/Proyecto-3---Music-App/assets/132446932/f963cbe0-2639-4950-81d2-6f41e4f9a7f5">
In a world where technology advances by leaps and bounds, it is essential that all aspects of daily life are within reach of those who face particular challenges. "Sound of Silence" is an ambitious project born from the understanding that people with hearing impairments often face a silent and disconnected environment. Detecting and understanding the sounds around us are essential elements for the safety, well-being and inclusion of these people in society.

The main objective of this project is the development of a revolutionary mobile application that will allow people with hearing impairment to experience the sound world around them. Through an intuitive interface and a focus on sound detection and categorization, "Sound of Silence" will provide a keyword.

This project focuses on utilizing cutting-edge technologies, including pre-trained AI models, frontend development with React, and robust backend logic implemented in Python. In addition, the importance of maintaining a history of the detected sounds for future service improvement is considered.

"Sound of Silence" is a step towards the inclusion and empowerment of people with hearing impairments, giving them the ability to experience the world through sound in a new and exciting way.

- **System Activation:** Users can activate the app using an activation button, allowing them to begin detecting sounds in their environment.

- **Sound Detection and Categorization:** The application is designed to detect and categorize sounds in the user's environment.

- **Show Keyword:** Along with the detected sound, the application shows four predictions along with their score for the detected sound.

- **Sign up:** People can sign up as users in the application.

- **Sound History Screen:** Users have access to a history screen that displays the most recently detected sounds along with their corresponding keywords.
